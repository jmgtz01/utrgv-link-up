## 💡 Overview
Stop wasting time walking across campus only to find the library full. **UTRGV Link-Up** is the all-in-one productivity tool built specifically for Vaqueros. This application cuts through the clutter, giving you instant access to the essential campus resources you need to succeed. 

Built with **Django** and a responsive **Bootstrap** frontend, Link-Up allows you to visualize computer lab availability, check the stock of media equipment (like cameras and laptops), and keep track of campus events—all from one dashboard.
